This workshop offers an introduction to the Arduino prototyping platform, useful for artists, hobbiests and the wider maker community. Each participant receives a pack containing an Arduino Uno and components to perform each of 5 simple experiments. No prior coding experience is needed as all code will be provided. The only requirement is the Arduino IDE, and a packed lunch!
